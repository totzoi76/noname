(27, 'HMAS Albatross History', '<p>HMAS&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;is the Royal Australian Navy&rsquo;s (RAN) Naval Air Station (NAS). Located at Nowra on the South Coast of New South Wales,&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;was commissioned on 31 August 1948 and over 40,000 Commonwealth servicemen and women have served there over the years. 2018 marked the 70th Anniversary of the RAN Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and its home at Nowra.</p>\n\n<p>The first Australian vessel to carry the name &lsquo;Albatross&rsquo; was the seaplane carrier commissioned into the RAN on 23 January 1929, at Cockatoo Dockyard in Sydney. She was paid off on 26 April 1933 and subsequently returned to the Admiralty as part payment for the new cruiser HMAS&nbsp;<em>Hobart</em>&nbsp;(I). She was recommissioned in the Royal Navy (RN) at the beginning of World War II and served with distinction before being sold in 1946.</p>\n\n<p>Following the Japanese surrender in September 1945, and having observed the success of United States Navy (USN) and RN air power during WWII, the Australian Government became convinced that the RAN also needed an air power capability. With that in mind, a young RAN officer was sent to the UK to gather information on what would be required, including shore establishments, to establish an FAA for the RAN. Lieutenant Commander (later Admiral Sir) Victor Alfred Trumper (VAT) Smith had served with distinction as an Observer in the RN during WWII and would become recognised as the &lsquo;Father of the Fleet Air Arm&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Lieutenant (later Admiral Sir) Victor Alfred Trumper Smith.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-2.jpg?itok=kKcyW0Sq\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Lieutenant (later Admiral Sir) Victor Alfred Trumper Smith.</p>\n\n<p>The WWII Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and RN aerodrome at Nowra, and its satellite airfield at Jervis Bay, was quickly identified as a suitable location for the RAN FAA&rsquo;s shore establishment. Flying had been going on at Nowra since 1930 where joy flights left from an area known as &lsquo;McDonald&rsquo;s Paddock&rsquo;. The Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) had granted a license to operate a municipal aerodrome from Nowra and, on 6 July 1935, an air pageant marked the opening of the aerodrome at Brown&#39;s Hole, about 6 miles (9.6km) from Nowra.</p>\n\n<p>In 1939 the Air Board advised the DCA that the RAAF would use the site as an Advanced Operational Base. The Government acquired 357 acres of land at the site on 14 June 1939 and a further 118 acres following the declaration of WWII. Redevelopment for RAAF purposes began in October 1939 and a further land acquisition of 50 acres followed shortly after. The base was ready for use on 21 July 1941 and became operational on 7 May the following year when a Reconnaissance Squadron and a Torpedo/Bomber Squadron arrived and commenced torpedo and bombing training. RAAF Bristol Beaufort bombers, US Army Air Corps B-26s and Netherlands East Indies Air Force B-25s all used the base during the War.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With the war in Europe drawing to a close, the&nbsp;RN&nbsp;was ordered to the Pacific to support the war against Japan. The British Pacific Fleet comprised some 265 ships with Sydney acting as its main Fleet Base. In order to meet the requirements of its aircraft when its carriers were docked, the&nbsp;RN&nbsp;developed the Mobile Base concept. Seven Mobile Operating Naval Air Base units (MONABs) were established in Australia. The MONABs were self-contained, mobile units formed to take over bare airfields and convert them into fully functioning naval airfields as required. MONAB 1 took over the Nowra Airfield late in 1944 and on 2 January 1945, it became Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Nowra, commissioned&nbsp;HMS&nbsp;<em>Nabbington</em>. By February, a constant stream of aircraft was moving through RNAS Nowra as&nbsp;RN&nbsp;aircraft carriers docked in Sydney for maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>HMS&nbsp;<em>Nabbington</em>&nbsp;decommissioned on 15 November 1945, shortly after the Japanese surrender, however RNAS Nowra continued to operate. MONAB 5, or&nbsp;HMS&nbsp;<em>Nabswick</em>, transferred from Jervis Bay to Nowra and the airfield was officially closed on 18 March 1946 and handed back to the&nbsp;RAAF&nbsp;in a caretaker capacity. The last&nbsp;RN&nbsp;aircraft departed on 5 May.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-3_2-4.jpg\"><img alt=\"Left: Disembarked Royal Navy aircraft at HMS Nabbington, circa 1945.

Although far from complete, many of the required facilities, such as hangars and workshops, were already in place at Nowra making it a logical choice for the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;FAAs new shore establishment. The name of the new Station was approved by King George VI in April 1948 and Naval Air Station (NAS) Nowra, HMAS&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;was commissioned on 31 August 1948.</p>\n\n<p>An advance party had left Sydney for Nowra on 8 May 1948 to begin transforming the wartime airfield into a Naval Air Station. The enormity of their task soon became apparent. The airfield had been vacant for the past two years and had been subjected to widespread vandalism. Extensive refurbishment was required to make the Station habitable.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;was to become the FAA&rsquo;s main training establishment. A number of schools had to be set up including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>School of Aircraft Maintenance - Engineering</li>\n	<li>School of Aircraft Maintenance - Electrical</li>\n	<li>School of Aircraft Maintenance - Radio</li>\n	<li>School of Aircraft Ordnance</li>\n	<li>Photographic School</li>\n	<li>Meteorological School</li>\n	<li>School of Aircraft Handling; and</li>\n	<li>Pilot and Observer Training Schools.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-6.jpg\"><img alt=\"One of the RAN\'s new Fireflies being taken ashore by a lighter with HMAS Sydney in the background.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-6.jpg?itok=4ElATqcb\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One of the RAN&rsquo;s new Fireflies being taken ashore by a lighter with HMAS Sydney in the background.</p>\n\n<p>The appropriate support facilities also had to be established such as classrooms, accommodation, galleys, stores and provisions for married personnel, as well as a dummy carrier flight deck for the School of Aircraft Handling. The runways also needed much work. Although described as having a &lsquo;tarmac&rsquo; surface, they were little more than compacted gravel and had a habit of breaking up, which had caused much consternation during the War. All this and only seven months to prepare for the arrival of the 20th Carrier Air Group (CAG) in May the following year.</p>\n\n<p>HMAS&nbsp;<em>Sydney</em>&nbsp;(III) arrived in Jervis Bay on 25 May 1949 with the FAAs first Naval Air Squadrons, 805 and 816 Squadrons, embarked. Two Supermarine Type 309 Sea Otters were lowered into the water and flew to Nowra while 27 Hawker Sea Fury FBIIs and 27 Fairey Firefly AS5s were landed ashore by aircraft lighters along with the associated stores, machinery, aircraft documentation and personal baggage. Once ashore, the aircraft were towed to Nowra in convoys, the last arriving on 29 May. It was another two weeks before flying could commence due to inclement weather.</p>\n\n<p>Stoker Eric Stevenson drove one of the trucks in the convoys:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the Sydney came out with a load of Sea Furies and Fireflies I was towing them from Jervis Bay to Nowra. The load being so heavy, I just made it up Nowra Hill, doing 2mph, the clutch slipping and a radiator that was boiling furiously. I couldn&#39;t stop otherwise I would be stuck. But I made it! Everybody cheered as I drove through the guard gates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-7.jpg\"><img alt=\"HMAS Sydney with the ship\'s company on deck and Fireflies and Sea Furies embarked.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-7.jpg?itok=Dwa-Kakv\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>HMAS Sydney with the ship&rsquo;s company on deck and Fireflies and Sea Furies embarked.</p>\n\n<p>The arrival of the CAG brought an extra 1000 people to the area, an increase in the local population of more than 10%. The formation of another CAG, the 21st, had already been approved and a third was being planned. The 21st CAG arrived in Jervis Bay on 6 December 1950 bringing with it another 23 Fireflies and 35 Sea Furies and all the associated personnel and equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Accommodation for the influx of personnel was proving to be a major problem. There was just enough basic accommodation for sailors on board but officers and families had to find accommodation where they could throughout the area, and rents soared accordingly. The &lsquo;Patch&rsquo;, as it became known, was established in October 1949 with five converted huts from the old&nbsp;RAAF&nbsp;torpedo unit complex and grew initially with tents and caravans, and later two blocks of tiny brick units and a number of prefabricated houses. The Nowra Showgrounds were also used as a temporary solution (though people were still living there as late as 1951) with tents and caravans extended with aircraft packing cases which had been used to ship Spitfires during WWII. Conditions were primitive and running water consisted of one common tap and ablutions block where hot water had to be paid for. Families did their laundry in a wood fired copper with a separate tub for rinsing. While construction moved at a steady pace, waiting lists for married quarters on board were so long during the 1950s that it was rare for a non-aviation specialist on a two year posting to qualify for one, and a two year tenancy limit was imposed on those who did get one. Many families commuted between Sydney and Nowra.</p>\n\n<h2>1950s</h2>\n\n<p>Sydney continued exercises early in 1951 following the Christmas/New Year leave period with one CAG ashore at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;undergoing maintenance while the other was embarked. The middle part of the year, however, became extremely busy as air crews were notified on 14 May that three Squadrons - 805, 808 and 817 - would embark in Sydney later that year for operations in Korea. 816 Squadron was disappointed to hear that it would remain in Australia.</p>\n\n<p>Deck crews were put through their paces at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;and the work up for Korea was as equally busy for them as for the pilots and observers. Mechanics kept the aircraft flying, handlers manoeuvred the aircraft into position and armourers maintained and stocked the aircraft ordnance. Flying warplanes requires a lot of hard and dangerous work, and attention to detail by a great number of people. Armourer Kev Raddatz remembers this incident in the Bomb Dump at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I remember as a young armourer being &lsquo;banished&rsquo; to the bomb dump and working in the Rocket Motor Magazine with a few hundred motors stored there, together with three steel tanks containing Instant Detonators for 10lb practice bombs. The job was to get the detonators for the bombs, so the Chief and I opened one of the tanks and commenced opening tins of detonators. The tins had a soldered metal sealing strip around them which had to be removed with a pair of pliers. We had been told on our initial trade course that the detonators could not be touched by hand as the body heat could set them off. Very touchy things that had to be handled with phosphor-bronze pincers.</p>\n\n<p>So here I am, standing flat-footed between two tanks, one open, one shut, and the wall behind me, while the Chief is standing at the corner of the open tank, and the remainder of the mob are in the clear space.</p>\n\n<p>The Chief starts to &lsquo;unzip&rsquo; one of the tins, everything goes well until a &lsquo;tough spot&rsquo; in the solder is encountered. To resolve this problem, the Chief gives it an extra hard tug...the tin flies out of his hand heading for the roof, detonators hurtling everywhere (don&rsquo;t forget, I had nowhere to go!), as if in slow motion the detonators bounced off the steel tank and the concrete floor - bodies running everywhere trying to climb the bomb proof walls - then silence. I heard myself say &ldquo;Bugger me! They didn&#39;t go off!&rdquo; The mob creeps back, the Chief is as white as a sheet - not a word said about the incident.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-8.jpg\"><img alt=\"HMAS Nirimba\'s commissioning company being inspected by Rear Admiral Henry Showers, 1 April 1953.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-8.jpg?itok=zzWA3-Qg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>HMAS Nirimba&rsquo;s commissioning company being inspected by Rear Admiral Henry Showers, 1 April 1953.</p>\n\n<p>Plans were progressing, in 1951, for a second Naval Air Station at the former&nbsp;RAAF&nbsp;Base Schofields at Quakers Hill, NSW. The new station was intended to be fully operational by July 1953 with a personnel complement of 600 and functions including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>A technical training school;</li>\n	<li>Reserve aircraft storage;</li>\n	<li>An aircraft maintenance yard;</li>\n	<li>Headquarters for the Commodore/Captain (Air);</li>\n	<li>Facilities for a disembarked air group; and</li>\n	<li>A reserve unit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The second station was commissioned as HMAS&nbsp;<em>Nirimba</em>&nbsp;on 1 April 1953. However, with Treasury tightening the purse strings and a general Government antipathy towards a second Naval Air Station, operations at&nbsp;<em>Nirimba</em>&nbsp;wound down before they fully got wound up. Subsequently,&nbsp;<em>Nirimba</em>&nbsp;became the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;Apprentice Training Establishment on 5 January 1956.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the construction work at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;also hit a snag when, in September 1951, the new &lsquo;H&rsquo; Hangar, which was under construction, collapsed in winds in excess of 180kph. However, this setback did not prevent the Australian Joint Anti-Submarine School (AJASS) from opening in December 1951 and, in 1953, a ditching pool also opened allowing air crew to practice evacuation from a submerged aircraft.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-9.jpg\"><img alt=\"HMAS Nirimba from the air.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-9.jpg?itok=-5HDaTMO\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>HMAS Nirimba from the air.</p>\n\n<p>February 1952 proved to be a tragic month for&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;and for 816 when it lost four of its members in two separate incidents. Lieutenant Brian Wall and Sub Lieutenant Douglas Saunders were both lost on 19 February when their Firefly went missing and was believed to have crashed into the sea near Moruya, NSW. Just three days later, a Firefly carrying Sub Lieutenant Durrant Small and Observer JG Sharp crashed into sea near Seven Mile Beach, NSW. Both Small and Sharp were killed. However, the return of&nbsp;<em>Sydney</em>&nbsp;from operations in Korea on 3 March 1952 and the formation of 723 Squadron on 7 April did much to lift spirits in Nowra.</p>\n\n<p>723 Squadron was a Fleet Requirements Unit permanently stationed at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>. As well as communications duties, search and rescue and refresher training for aircrew, the Squadron also provided air support for the AJASS. On 11 March 1953, the Squadron took delivery of the&nbsp;RAN&rsquo;s first rotary wing aircraft; three Bristol Sycamore HR 50 helicopters. Lieutenant Don Farquarson,&nbsp;RN, ran the first helicopter pilot training course in Australia at Albatross, assisted by Lieutenants Gordon McPhee and Neil MacMillan.</p>\n\n<p><em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;was gradually becoming a more comfortable and hospitable place in which to live. Although an early suggestion to include members of the Women&rsquo;s Royal Australian Navy (WRAN) into the ship&rsquo;s complement was quickly dismissed, the construction of a cinema and the spontaneous formation of the volunteer Naval Blue Jacket Band in the early 1950s provided some much needed entertainment for the crew. The band developed an excellent reputation and played at many ceremonial events including the opening of Parliament in Canberra and the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>.</p>\n\n<p>On 18 June 1954, 723 Squadron took delivery of the&nbsp;RAN&rsquo;s first jet aircraft. Lieutenant Peter Goldrick accepted the de Havilland Sea Vampire Mk T22 at the de Havilland workshops in Bankstown before flying the aircraft to its permanent home at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>. The Sea Vampire was used as a land based trainer for air crews converting to the soon to be delivered Sea Venom.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-10.jpg\"><img alt=\"A restored Firefly now with the RAN Historical flight bearing UN markings as they did during the Korean War.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-10.jpg?itok=rjosyDIQ\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A restored Firefly now with the RAN Historical flight bearing UN markings as they did during the Korean War.</p>\n\n<p>With more families moving into the married quarters at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>, attention soon turned to the education requirements of the resident children. Approval was given in 1954 to establish a primary school on the old Nowra Hill School site with extra land secured to enlarge the school&#39;s recreation area. The Nowra Hill Public School opened on 22 October 1955.</p>\n\n<p>Integration with the local population had been a problem ever since the first sailors arrived at Nowra in 1948. A lack of amenities in town for the sailors meant that relations were often strained and on 19 April 1949, a public meeting was held to determine how best to resolve the problem. A committee was established at the meeting involving both service personnel from&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;and members of the local community with the aim of raising funds to establish a venue in town for sailors to relax when off duty. Their efforts came to fruition when, on 21 October 1954, the White Ensign Club was officially opened by Vice Admiral Sir John Collins, KBE, CB,&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;(Ret&rsquo;d) in a renovated building which had once been the Nowra Maternity Hospital. It included sleeping accommodation, a kitchen and canteen, billiard room, reading room and a chapel. Bar facilities were provided in accordance with&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;regulations. The Club was a favourite amongst&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;personnel for many years.</p>\n\n<p>Community service tasks quickly became a feature of operations at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>, particularly for 723 Squadron&rsquo;s Sycamores. The Squadron rescued over 100 people in February 1955 in flood relief operations in Dubbo, Maitland and Narrabri as well as other Search and Rescue, and Police assistance operations throughout the 1950s.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-11_2-12.jpg\"><img alt=\"Left: A Sycamore on the tarmac at HMAS Albatross.

Right: A Sea Vampire on the tarmac at HMAS Albatross.</p>\n\n<p><em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;received high praise when Lord and Lady Mountbatten visited the Station on 9 April 1956. Each had a flight in a glider from the base gliding club and a headline in the Daily Telegraph of 11 April read &ldquo;Australian Naval Station &ldquo;smartest I&rsquo;ve seen&rdquo; says Mountbatten.&rdquo; The story went on:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lord Mountbatten yesterday described the Naval Air Station HMAS Albatross at Nowra as the smartest station he had ever seen. &ldquo;Of any type, in any service, in any country,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-13.jpg\"><img alt=\"Aircraft on the tarmac at HMAS Albatross.

In the foreground are Gannets followed by Sea Venoms, Sea Vampires, a Dakota and Wessex helicopters.</p>\n\n<p>HMAS&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&nbsp;(II) arrived in Australia for the first time at the end April 1956 and disembarked her cocooned aircraft at Jervis Bay the following month. Recalling similar activities seven years earlier, the new de Havilland Sea Venom FAW. Mk 53s and Fairey Gannet AS1s, and the associated personnel and stores, were towed to&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;by road. A period of intense activity followed as aircrews at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;worked up and familiarised themselves with the new aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>Captain VAT Smith assumed command of&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;on 14 January 1957. Three squadrons were permanently stationed at NAS Nowra while the other three were normally embarked in&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>. The FAA was conducting its own Operational Flying Schools for aircrew graduating out of the&nbsp;RAAF&nbsp;system and a decompression chamber was made available for use by the Jet Conversion Unit. Training schools had been established for helicopter pilots, observers, aircraft handlers and safety equipment sailors, and a number of engineering courses were run from&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>. The AJASS was still resident, with flying support coming from 723 Squadron, and a number of recreational clubs had been established with more emerging all the time.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of all this, morale was low at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>. Captain Smith immediately set about rectifying the situation. Divisions became more regular, strict adherence to the timetable was encouraged and gardening became a mandatory activity on Friday afternoons. Not only did this allow those travelling out of Nowra for the weekend to get away early and avoid traffic, it also broke up the monotony of the usual workday routine and promoted pride in the Station.</p>\n\n<p>A number of construction projects also received funding as part of a Navy-wide construction program totalling &pound;2.25 million. More married quarters were built and some of the WWII huts serving as sailors&rsquo; accommodation were replaced. A new air traffic control building and battery charging workshop were approved as was the development of the Beecroft Bombing Range and surface ships&#39; bombardment range, which also involved the construction of an operational observation post.</p>\n\n<p>Captain Smith took on a rather unusual role when the NSW Government dismissed the Council of the Shoalhaven Shire and appointed an administrator in 1957. In the absence of a Shire President, Smith was called upon to perform a number of civic duties. This situation helped to improve relations between&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;and the local community, and the community expressed its appreciation of Smith&#39;s efforts with a civic farewell when he and his wife, Nanette, departed in November 1959.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross.jpg\"><img alt=\"Vice Admiral Sir Roy Dowling RAN addresses the assembled guests during an inspection of HMAS Albatross.

The FAA continued to meet its responsibilities and maintain its extraordinarily high, exacting standards.</p>\n\n<p>The Government had indicated in 1960 that an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopter component of the service would be maintained but this did little to raise the morale of those who had spent most of their working lives in fixed wing naval aviation. By the end of 1963, 724 (stationed at&nbsp;<em>Albatross)&nbsp;</em>and 816 Squadrons were the only FAA Squadrons operating fixed wing aircraft until fixed wing operations recommenced in earnest in 1968. Fixed wing flying training was meant to cease in 1961, however, fixed wing training continued at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;under the auspices of 724 Squadron.</p>\n\n<p>January 1964 heralded the arrival of the first&nbsp;WRANs at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>. Some 70&nbsp;WRANs were posted taking up positions such as radar plotters in the AJASS, administration, radio operators, transport drivers, sick berth attendants, cooks and stewards. The number soon increased to 90 and the new arrivals settled in very quickly.</p>\n\n<p>On 10 February 1964 at 8:56pm,&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&nbsp;(II) collided with HMAS&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em>&nbsp;(II) in one of the most tragic accidents in Australian naval history. The disaster resulted in the loss of 82 lives, all from&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em>&nbsp;(II).&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&nbsp;(II) had been manoeuvring to find sufficient wind over the deck to allow for Gannet and Sea Venom Deck Landing Practice (DLP). The Commanding Officer of 816 Squadron, Lieutenant Commander Toz Dadswell (later Commodore Dadswell, AM) was approaching&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&nbsp;(II) in his Gannet at the time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I approached the ship from the port quarter in a descending turn. I noted that Voyager was not in the correct RESDES [Rescue Destroyer] position. At 20:56 a huge ball of flame lit the sky. It was the boiler room of Voyager exploding.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the collision, Melbourne (II) had lost a number of aerials which had been lowered to the horizontal position for flying, so the ship asked me to activate the rescue services at Nowra. I advised Nowra that there was an emergency and to send all available helicopters to the scene and to also sail the search and rescue craft from Jervis Bay...It was an outstanding effort by the helicopter squadrons and in a very short time helicopters were over the accident area. In fact at one stage there were probably too many aircraft in the one small area...At first light the fixed wing squadrons had aircraft there and we continued to fly all through the day in the hope of finding survivors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-15.jpg\"><img alt=\"Survivors in the aftermath of the Voyager disaster.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-15.jpg?itok=jJmquIPS\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Survivors in the aftermath of the Voyager disaster.</p>\n\n<p>Aircraft from&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;participated in search and rescue efforts in the aftermath of the collision.</p>\n\n<p>The air strip at Jervis Bay underwent its own expansion program in mid-1965 when it became home to the&nbsp;RAN&#39;s new GAF Jindivik pilotless target drone. Designed and built in Australia, the remote controlled GAF Jindivik, affectionately known as &lsquo;Jindy&rsquo;, had an excellent speed and altitude performance profile, and could trail smoke, heat or other sources from winches to test the discrimination of weapons systems detectors during live firings. A new hangar was constructed to house the aircraft and the associated equipment, and accommodation blocks were renovated to house the influx of staff. The facility opened in January 1967.</p>\n\n<p>The courage of naval airmen was displayed on the morning 21 May 1966 when&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;scrambled two Iroquois from 723 Squadron to search for survivors from the Dredge WD Atlas which had capsized about 18 kilometres south east of Jervis Bay. The pilots, Lieutenants Pat Vickers and Barrie Lovett, and their crews, Petty Officers Peters and McCreanon, hovered their helicopters in 45 knot winds just a few feet over ten metre waves. Thirteen sailors lost their lives but thanks to the efforts of the airmen, four others were rescued. When an officer proposed that 723 Squadron deserved an Albert Medal for saving life at sea, the suggestion was laughed out of the&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;mess. The Navy News reported on 10 June 1966 &ldquo;The pilots...do not think they are heroes, daredevils or stuntmen. Just men doing their job.&rdquo; PO McCreanon was honoured with a Queen&#39;s Commendation for his bravery in the rescue.</p>\n\n<p>A reappraisal of the Naval Three Year Plan in 1965, due partly to a deterioration in the political climate in Australia&rsquo;s area of interest and partly to a lot of hard work at Navy Office, put fixed wing naval aviation back on the agenda. The Department of Defence recognised that without fighter protection, the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;would be unable to meet its commitments to Australian forces overseas. It was decided that the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;would purchase ten new McDonnell Douglas A-4G Skyhawks, including two TA-4G model trainers, and 14 Grumman S-2E Trackers to embark in Melbourne following her refit in 1968. Pilots and ground crew started training at Albatross as early as mid-1966 and the new aircraft were transported to Australia by&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&nbsp;in November 1967. Just as had happened twice before, the Skyhawks were disembarked at Jervis Bay and transported by road to&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>. The Trackers, however, remained aboard&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&nbsp;until she reached Sydney where they were transported by road to Mascot Airport, checked, flight tested and flown to&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;later in the year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-16.jpg\"><img alt=\"A GAF Jindivik pilotless drone being refuelled.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-16.jpg?itok=zzQlytSL\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A GAF Jindivik pilotless drone being refuelled.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, a Tracker simulator was also ordered at a cost of $2.5m with an ongoing maintenance contract of $80,000 pa. The Weapons System Trainer (WST) was to be built into two trailers, allowing it to be towed, with the cockpits and instrument console in one trailer, and the computer, associated electronics and workshop in the other trailer. The WST was meant to be operating by the end of 1967 but a fire, started by an urn that had been left on overnight, caused enough damage that it was returned to the US before it was commissioned. It would later be installed in a purpose built brick building at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;and became operational in May 1970.</p>\n\n<p>Lieutenant Commanders John Da Costa (805 Squadron Commanding Officer) and Graeme King (805 Squadron Senior Pilot) travelled to the US to learn how to fly and instruct on the Skyhawk and, along with Lieutenant Mike Gump, USN, conducted the first conversions and Operational Flying School (OFS). The first six pilots began training at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;in January 1968 but stores problems quickly brought training to a standstill. Maintenance crews were having problems getting spare parts for engines, airframes and weapons systems and even had to resort to using cumbersome folding step ladders in place of boarding ladders to get people into and out of the aircraft. The Government had planned to send graduating OFS Skyhawk pilots to Vietnam to serve in US Marine Corps (USMC) squadrons. However, the stores problems meant that the first OFS course finished six months late and by this time, the US policy in Vietnam had become one of &lsquo;de-escalation&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>That, however, did not preclude&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;involvement in Vietnam. The&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;already had a significant presence in the region with HMAS&nbsp;<em>Sydney</em>&nbsp;(III), converted to a fast troop ship, deploying troops as early as May 1965, and a Clearance Diving Team and a destroyer operating in Vietnam from February and March 1967 respectively. On 14 July 1967, the Minister for Defence, Mr Allen Fairhall, responded to a US request to Australia for helicopters and crews to provide combat support to the war effort by announcing that the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;would provide eight pilots, four observers, 24 maintenance personnel, four air crewmen and six support staff. The detachment, known as the Royal Australian Navy Helicopter Flight Vietnam (RANHFV), served as part of the US Army&rsquo;s 135th Assault Helicopter Company (AHC) flying Bell UH/1B and UH/1H Iroquois helicopters.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-17.jpg\"><img alt=\"Trackers at HMAS Albatross.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-17.jpg?itok=xOjJ5lRn\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Trackers at HMAS Albatross.</p>\n\n<p>Pilots were drawn from existing FAA Squadrons and were officially allocated to 723 Squadron, undertaking eight weeks of training with the Squadron at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>. The first flight formed and operational training began on 28 August 1967. Their training included troop lift, insertion and support as well as survival training, code of conduct training, small arms and colloquial language. 723 Squadron suspended all other activities to devote all possible resources to training the RANHFV. No. 5 Squadron&nbsp;RAAF&nbsp;also assisted by providing M60 door guns and mounts as well other advice and assistance, and the flight completed training by conducting field exercises with the Australian Army.</p>\n\n<p>Four contingents of the RANHFV served in Vietnam between 1967 and 1971, with a further RAN detachment serving with 9 Squadron RAAF in 1968/69, though the dangers of flying were not limited to those overseas. On 5 June 1968, three members of 723 Squadron, Lieutenant Peter Ward, Petty Officer DJ Sanderson and NAMAE RK Smith, were lost when their Iroquois crashed over the cliff at Beecroft Head Firing Range and into the sea while on a range clearing flight. The aircraft had just landed a fourth crew member, Lieutenant Robert Ray, who reported the crash to&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Improvements and upgrades continued at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;with a new avionics workshop constructed and new surveillance radar installed. A new Tactical Air Control Air Navigation (an ultra high frequency electronic air navigation system) installation was operational by the end of the decade. New &lsquo;Bliss&rsquo; arrestor gear was also installed, replacing the primitive system of arrestor wires stretched across the runway attached to anchor cables. The new system could operate in either direction on the runway (the old system could only operate in one direction) and was capable of arresting an aircraft with engine failure on take off, brake failure on landing, and could handle all aircraft in service with the FAA.</p>\n\n<p><em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;celebrated its 21st Anniversary with an Air Day on 12 October 1969. A static display covered some 15,000 square metres of hangar space and a tarmac display featuring Sea Furies, Fireflies and Gannets. The aerial display included Skyhawks, Trackers, Iroquois and Westland Wessex Mk 31B helicopters as well as a display by the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;Gliding Club. The Air Day was a huge success with the Skyhawks stealing the show.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-18_19_20.jpg\"><img alt=\"Left: A Skyhawk TA-4G Trainer at HMAS Albatross.

The first arrived at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;on 7 June, flown from the Hawker Siddeley factory in Woodford near Manchester marking the first transglobal flight by&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;personnel. The second aircraft arrived on 17 August 1973. The twin turboprop HS748s were used for navigation training, communications and transport duties, and also took part in continuation trials for the Ikara missile system.</p>\n\n<p>The FAA became embroiled in industrial unrest in July 1974 when the Storeman and Packers Union black-banned the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;resulting in fuel shortages and flying restrictions. This became a serious, and even life threatening, issue the following month when heavy rain and flooding inundated the Nowra area. The FAA was called upon for disaster relief operations but the fuel shortage gave rise to concerns about whether rescue efforts would have to cease. Eventually common sense prevailed and fuel tankers began to arrive allowing personnel from&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;to rescue some 352 people.</p>\n\n<p>1974 also saw a number of people, mostly volunteers, devote much time and effort towards establishing a Naval Aviation Museum. Admiral Sir Victor Smith KBE CB DFC, by then Chief of the Defence Force Staff, opened the Museum in &lsquo;D&rsquo; Hangar at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>. Various aircraft that had been saved by previous Commanding Officers, along with many recovered from the dump, were cleaned, repaired, repainted and assembled together undercover. The Museum has undergone many changes over the years but remains a popular attraction at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;to this day and also features dioramas, photographs, models and other assorted paraphernalia and ephemera.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-22.jpg\"><img alt=\"Naval Headquarters in Darwin in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-22.jpg?itok=rHeO0p0z\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Naval Headquarters in Darwin in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy.</p>\n\n<p><em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;personnel were called into action to assist in relief efforts for one of the most devastating natural disasters in Australian history in 1974. When Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin on Christmas Eve,&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;personnel were called back to NAS Nowra, leaving their homes and loved ones at Christmas time, to begin support flights to the northern capital. Many travelled from as far a field as South Australia and Queensland with many more making contact from Central and Western Australia to see if they were needed. After picking up personnel and supplies in Sydney, the HS748s of VC851 Squadron were on the ground in Darwin by Boxing Day. Meanwhile, the Wessex helicopters of HS817 Squadron were en route embarked in HMA Ships&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&nbsp;(III) and&nbsp;<em>Stalwart</em>&nbsp;(II).</p>\n\n<p>The HS748s approach to the Darwin airfield was made over a relatively unpopulated area so the full devastation of the Cyclone was not immediately apparent to the crew. However, the Commanding Officer of VC851 Squadron, Commander Jim Campbell, later said that the force of Tracy was evident when he saw &ldquo;a large white refrigerator firmly wedged in the branches of a tree about 40 to 50 feet (12-15 metres) above the ground.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>There was no hangar for the crew to work in once they landed, just an open concrete area. Maintenance support consisted of the maintenance personnel who accompanied the flight, and the tools and spares they brought with them. The maintainers would double as flight stewards for those being evacuated on the return flight, mainly naval dependants from HMAS&nbsp;<em>Coonawarra</em>, and converted the rear sections of the planes into an area for children to play and sleep. Maintenance personnel at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;were then faced with a 12 hour overnight period to service, prepare and load the aircraft with freight for an 8:00am departure the next morning. The families of&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;personnel also collected pharmaceuticals for distribution in Darwin as well as toys and magazines.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-23.jpg\"><img alt=\"Tasman Bridge on the Derwent River after the collapse.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-23.jpg?itok=Yo0Ld4Ah\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Tasman Bridge on the Derwent River after the collapse.</p>\n\n<p><em>Melbourne</em>, meanwhile, arrived in Darwin on 2 January 1975 and HS817 Squadron&rsquo;s helicopters made an immediate impact on Operation NAVY HELP DARWIN. The Squadron was able to conduct search and rescue sorties in areas that had previously been inaccessible enabling evacuations to be carried out quickly and over great distances.</p>\n\n<p>The relief effort for Darwin was interrupted in the early hours of 6 January 1975 when VC851 Squadron was again called upon to provide assistance, this time in Tasmania. At 9:27pm the previous evening, the bulk carrier&nbsp;<em>Lake Illawarra</em>&nbsp;collided with the Tasman Bridge on the Derwent River collapsing two piers and 127 metres of bridge decking. Five commuters and seven crew members from the Lake Illawarra lost their lives. At 1:15am on the morning of 6 January 1975, VC851 Squadron received word that they were required to fly a Navy Clearance Diving Team to the scene. An HS748 was prepared and departed&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;for Sydney at 2:30am. It arrived in Hobart five hours later.</p>\n\n<p>In the days following Tracy, VC851 Squadron completed 14 return flights amounting to 222 flying hours, carried 485 passengers and 22,700kgs of freight. Their outstanding performance in aftermath of Cyclone Tracy and the Tasman Bridge Disaster drew high praise from the Flag Officer Commanding East Australian Area, Rear Admiral Neil McDonald:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have been informed by the Commanding Officer, HMAS Albatross of the exceptional devotion to duty of the Commanding Officer, Officers and sailors of VC851 HS748 Flight during the period 25 December, 1974 to 10 January, 1975.</p>\n\n<p>The zeal and enthusiasm displayed throughout the preparation for, and conduct of the 14 sorties as part of Operation NAVY HELP DARWIN in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy, and which enabled a sortie to transport a rescue team to Hobart as a result of the Tasman Bridge disaster during this operation, is most commendable.</p>\n\n<p>The conduct of the flight, the motivation displayed despite personal discomfort caused by long hours reflects great credit on all officers and sailors concerned. I would be grateful if you would inform all those involved of my admiration of their conduct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-24.jpg\"><img alt=\"RAN sailors unloading bags of cement in Darwin.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-24.jpg?itok=JasfNaWh\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>RAN sailors unloading bags of cement in Darwin.</p>\n\n<p>Darwin&rsquo;s mayor, Harry &lsquo;Tiger&rsquo; Brennan, echoed the Rear Admiral&#39;s commendation saying &ldquo;We owe the Navy the greatest debt of all.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Both Tracker squadrons, VC851 and VS816, suffered major setbacks on 4 December 1976 when most of their aircraft were destroyed in a hangar fire at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>. At around midnight that evening, &lsquo;H&rsquo; Hangar, the same one that had blown down in high winds 25 years earlier, was engulfed in flames and all but three of the&nbsp;RAN&rsquo;s Tracker fleet were lost. One of these was at the Hawker de Havilland workshops in Bankstown at the time, undergoing inspection.</p>\n\n<p>Around 100&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;personnel and local Nowra fire fighters risked their lives battling the flames and trying to drag aircraft from the burning building. The Trackers&rsquo; fuel tanks were fully loaded with volatile aviation fuel to avoid water contamination from condensation forming in the fuel tanks over the Christmas period. In spite of the inherent danger, personnel ran into the building and climbed into the cockpits of the aircraft to release the brakes and tow them clear of the hangar while the planes themselves were ablaze, in some cases, using their own cars to do so. They managed to pull five of the twelve aircraft in the hangar clear; two of them were repaired and returned to service. Their courageous actions drew high praise from the Minister for Defence, Mr Jim Killen, who said after visiting&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;on 5 December 1976:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If any people in this country think guts has gone from the Services, I invite them to reflect on what happened in the early hours of this morning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-25.jpg\"><img alt=\"Sailors fighting the hangar fire at HMAS Albatross on the night of 4 December 1976.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_left/public/Albatross2-25.jpg?itok=5rASLzIC\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Sailors fighting the hangar fire at HMAS Albatross on the night of 4 December 1976.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-26.jpg\"><img alt=\"The remains of Tracker aircraft in what was left of \'H\' Hangar after the fire.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_left/public/Albatross2-26.jpg?itok=xLA9f9H1\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The remains of Tracker aircraft in what was left of &lsquo;H&rsquo; Hangar after the fire.</p>\n\n<p>Sixteen officers and sailors were later commended for their actions.</p>\n\n<p>Police suspected arson and a Board of Inquiry was immediately announced. On 19 January 1977, a 19 year old junior sailor from one of the Tracker squadrons admitted to starting the fire. He was subsequently found to be mentally unstable at his court-martial. The fire had also forced the temporary closure and subsequent relocation of the Australian Naval Aviation Museum.</p>\n\n<p>The fire had crippled the FAA&rsquo;s fixed wing&nbsp;ASW&nbsp;capabilities. However, the following months displayed the excellent relationship that the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;had developed with the&nbsp;USN&nbsp;as the&nbsp;RAN&rsquo;s&nbsp;ASW&nbsp;component was not only replenished but increased in astonishingly quick time. Six more modern second hand Trackers had already been ordered in October 1976 and delivery was being organised at the time of the fire. This order was expanded to sixteen and an&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;team travelled to the US to hand pick the aircraft from&nbsp;USN&nbsp;stores. The aircraft were duly supplied and the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;received them at a massive discount, as much as 97 percent.</p>\n\n<p>The 1970s had been an eventful decade for the FAA, and while all this was going on, the Station continued to be upgraded. New works included a mechanical workshop, air surveillance radar, a fuel storage area and an upgraded Air Traffic Control system. Accommodation also continued to be upgraded including a new Wardroom and Senior Sailors Mess. The decade came to a close with&nbsp;HMA&nbsp;Ships&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Creswell</em>&nbsp;granted the first Freedom of Entry to the newly established City of Shoalhaven (replacing the previous Shoalhaven Shire Council) on 24 November 1979.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-27_28.jpg\"><img alt=\"Left: Lieutenant Commander Terry Ford leads Officers Divisions at the Freedom of Entry parade on Junction Street, Nowra 1979.

Michael Baume in 1983.</p>\n\n<p>Around 1600 personnel were stationed at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;at the beginning of the 1980s. New construction work continued as&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;entered the new decade with work commencing on a multi-million dollar &lsquo;fuel farm&rsquo; to replace the old storage facility. The realisation that Station security needed to be addressed in the aftermath of the 1976 hangar fire saw Naval Police and Guard Dogs take up that role. New kennels were built in the early 1980s to accommodate&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&#39; new canine residents.</p>\n\n<p>In 1982, the FAA provided aircrew, Air Traffic Controllers and sailors for a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Sinai overseeing the implementation of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Although ostensibly a&nbsp;RAAF&nbsp;operation, naval personnel supplemented the commitment until 1986.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of its commendable service, the future of fixed wing naval aviation remained in doubt. The chances of acquiring a new carrier to replace&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&nbsp;(III) when she paid off in the mid-1980s became increasingly thin and Naval Aviation&rsquo;s focus became firmly fixed on rotary wing and Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing (VSTOL) aircraft. It seemed almost certain that the Trackers and Skyhawks of the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;would cease operations after&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&rsquo;s demise. However, the surveillance capabilities of the Trackers, highlighted during the Trochus operations in northern Australia and anti-terrorism patrols in Bass Strait, suggested that they may yet have a future in shore based&nbsp;ASW&nbsp;or surveillance tasks.</p>\n\n<p>Following&nbsp;<em>Melbourne</em>&rsquo;s decommissioning in June 1982 it was not long before the&nbsp;RAN&rsquo;s two front-line fixed wing squadrons, VF805 and VS816, were disbanded at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;on 2 July 1982. The last ever flypast of&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;fixed wing aircraft occurred on 8 December 1983 at a graduation ceremony at HMAS&nbsp;<em>Creswell</em>. VC851 Squadron, the last of the&nbsp;RAN&rsquo;s fixed wing squadrons, decommissioned at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;on 31 August 1984. The Squadron&rsquo;s HS748s were transferred to HC723 Squadron where they performed electronic warfare training support and VIP transport duties from&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;until they were decommissioned on 30 June 2000.</p>\n\n<p>Just as they had done 20 years earlier when fixed wing naval aviation was discontinued, the men and women of the FAA displayed commendable dedication during this uncertain period.&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;Commanding Officer at the time, Commodore Tom&nbsp;&lsquo;Toz&rsquo;&nbsp;Dadswell AM, said in his farewell speech in April 1984,&nbsp;&ldquo;Never has a Commanding Officer been given so much loyal support and had so little to give in return.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Although fixed wing operations ceased in 1984, embarked helicopter operations did not and the FAA&#39;s activities continued with a renewed focus on rotary-wing aviation. Between 1980 and 1990 RAN helicopters from 723, 816 and 817 Squadrons provided specialist air support to Special Forces protecting offshore oil rigs in Bass Strait against potential terrorist attacks. The counter terrorist (CT) role proved difficult and demanding for those involved and HU 816 Squadron&#39;s Wessex 31B helicopters were to shoulder much of the workload; a task undertaken with great vigour.</p>\n\n<p>Helicopters also continued to embark in&nbsp;HMA&nbsp;Ships&nbsp;<em>Moresby</em>,&nbsp;<em>Stalwart</em>,&nbsp;<em>Jervis Bay</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tobruk</em>&nbsp;and would later do so in&nbsp;<em>Success</em>,&nbsp;<em>Kanimbla</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Manoora</em>&nbsp;and each of the&nbsp;RAN&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Adelaide</em>&nbsp;Class Guided Missile Frigates. When embarked, they did so as detached flights rather than as a squadron. This change in the way squadrons normally operated necessitated a change in training and technical support procedures at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;enabling these small units to operate largely independently, with their respective commanding officers&nbsp;normally based at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Search and Rescue operations remained a primary component of&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&rsquo; responsibilities. Commodore Howard Berger LVO,&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;CO&nbsp;at the time, recalls one such operation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In June 1985 the patrol boat HMAS Wollongong (II) struck rocks near Gabo Island seeking shelter from a Bass Strait storm. The Albatross&nbsp;XO&nbsp;was a patrol boat veteran and was informed at midnight that he was leaving on a 300 kilometre Sea King flight in twenty minutes and that perhaps he should take a sweater as the weather was shocking, and he could expect to be away for a week in the open on an isolated beach. The flotation bags and salvage equipment carried by the helicopters contributed to a successful refloating several days later. A Sea King helicopter landed in the car park of a takeaway restaurant in Mallacoota, loaded forty hamburgers and returned to give the salvage personnel their first hot meal for days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-29.jpg\"><img alt=\"Squirrel helicopters and a HS748 in front \'B\' Hangar at HMAS Albatross.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_right/public/Albatross2-29.jpg?itok=LN1yxrT5\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Squirrel helicopters and a HS748 in front &#39;B&#39; Hangar at HMAS Albatross.</p>\n\n<p>With the number of personnel stationed at&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;falling, and the local Shoalhaven economy feeling the losses, the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;started to encourage other defence activities to use the excellent facilities at NAS Nowra. Army exercises became a more regular occurrence in the area and&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;also became a popular venue for Defence related seminars. By the end of 1986, the number of Defence visitors to&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;had reached record levels. Much effort was also put into the Naval Aviation Museum to increase visitor numbers and therefore its economic viability. Coach tours were encouraged and displays rearranged to emphasise the technological advancements in Naval Aviation over the years. Historic flight days were also introduced on a monthly basis. The decreasing numbers did, however, enable a rationalisation of on site accommodation with a number of older buildings being removed, renovations for others, as well as a general beautification program for the Station.</p>\n\n<p>The FAA made a significant contribution to the&nbsp;RAN&rsquo;s 75th Anniversary celebrations in 1986. The previous year, a&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;Sea King had successfully flown a Victorian State Flag measuring 48 feet by 24 feet for the 150th Anniversary Bay Day celebrations on 2 November. On 24 January 1986, a fly past in Sydney Harbour featured a Sea King flying a large White Ensign. A number of fly pasts followed throughout the year including at the at unveiling of the National Naval Memorial by Queen Elizabeth II, the&nbsp;RAN&rsquo;s 75th Anniversary Fleet Review and the James Hardie 1000 Motor Race at Bathurst (the&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;also flew Prince Philip to Bathurst in a Sea King). Sea Kings also provided transport for Pope John Paul II during his visit to Australia and personnel from&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;also provided a Royal Guard for his visit.</p>\n\n<p>On 6 October 1986, 30,000 people attended the&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;Air Show which featured aircraft from the Australian, UK and US Armed Forces as well as a number of vintage aircraft. It was also during 1986 that the Australian Joint Anti-Submarine School was renamed the Australian Joint Maritime Warfare Centre before moving to&nbsp;RAAF&nbsp;Base Williamtown in December 1990.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-31.jpg\"><img alt=\"A Sea King flies the White Ensign.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_left/public/Albatross2-31.jpg?itok=pakE-0_V\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A Sea King flies the White Ensign.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-32.jpg\"><img alt=\"His Excellency the Governor-General Bill Hayden signs the guest book at the Naval Aviation Museum in 1988.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_left/public/Albatross2-32.jpg?itok=BOqVq1gU\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>His Excellency the Governor-General Bill Hayden signs the guest book at the Naval Aviation Museum in 1988.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Albatross2-33.jpg\"><img alt=\"An Iroquois takes off from HMAS Albatross for the last time on 31 May 1989, piloted by Lieutenant Keith Champion and Albatross Commanding Officer, Commodore Matt Taylor, sitting right seat.\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_left/public/Albatross2-33.jpg?itok=JJDY8tWN\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>An Iroquois takes off from HMAS Albatross for the last time on 31 May 1989, piloted by Lieutenant Keith Champion and Albatross Commanding Officer, Commodore Matt Taylor, sitting right seat.</p>\n\n<p>Ceremonial duties again came to the fore in 1988 as the FAA made significant contributions to Bicentennial celebrations around the country.&nbsp;RAN&nbsp;helicopters participated in an Australia Day fly past over Canberra which included some 160 Defence Force aircraft, in the Bicentennial Naval Salute on Sydney Harbour in October with Sea Kings again flying flags, and the Bicentennial Airshow at&nbsp;RAAF&nbsp;Base Richmond later that same month.</p>\n\n<p>Moves were also made early in 1988 to establish a new home for Naval Aviation Museum. A committee was established under the chairmanship of Rear Admiral Andrew Robertson to raise funds for a new hangar for the Museum. A foundation stone for the new building was laid down by Admiral Sir VAT Smith in October and construction began in earnest the following year.

In 1989, they were again called upon to provide a community service of a different kind. Following the breakdown in talks between commercial pilots and domestic airlines, the Government decided to break the pilots strike by using Defence aircraft to transport civilian passengers. Over the course of four months, HC723 Squadron&rsquo;s HS748 flight carried over 10,000 passengers between Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Hobart and Launceston. Prime Minister Bob Hawke travelled to&nbsp;<em>Albatross</em>&nbsp;to personally congratulate the crews (there were only three), and the Flight was awarded the Navy League of Australia Plaque for Aid to the Civilian Community and would later be adopted by the City of Launceston.</p>\n\n<p>An era also came to an end in December 1989 with the iconic Wessex and Iroquois helicopters both being decommissioned.

(41, 'A Brief History of Australian Naval Uniforms', '<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2008, disruptive pattern navy uniform (DPNU) was officially introduced in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). A practical rig, it is far removed from the more traditional naval uniform popularised throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. Today customary &lsquo;sailor suits&rsquo; are reserved chiefly for ceremonial occasions, however, on those occasions when they are worn, they serve to remind Australians of the longevity of their Navy, its traditions and its consistent contribution to our nation&rsquo;s maritime and economic security over more than 100 years.This article traces the origins of Australian naval uniforms following a process of continuous evolution as shifting social attitudes, new technologies, wars, and even religion have all influenced changes to the apparel worn by members of the senior service.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Origins</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian naval dress descends directly from that worn by the Royal Navy (RN) in the late 19th century. When the Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865 was passed, which permitted the Australian colonies to raise their own naval forces, officers of the RN had been wearing a standardised form of uniform for over one hundred years. In the case of men, uniform for petty officers, seamen and boys, collectively known as ratings, was formally established in January 1857. Both officers and ratings of the RN, dressed in their smart blue or white uniforms, were recognisable the world over as belonging to the most powerful navy afloat and it was hardly surprising that the Australian colonies of Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland each decided that their infant naval forces should be similarly attired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20001.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20001.jpg?itok=LYl6zCpx\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: Lieutenant JS Dumaresq dressed in a late 19th century Royal Naval frock coat and cocked hat. Australian born, Dumaresq served in the Royal Navy, but was destined to later take command of the Royal Australian Navy fleet. Right: A Royal Navy gunnery rating wearing late 19th century uniform that popularised the &#39;sailor suit&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Admiralty, however, concerned about certain legal aspects surrounding Australia&rsquo;s new naval forces, was adamant that colonial naval officers and men were not to wear uniforms that could not be distinguished from those of the RN. Consequently, the colonies adopted RN uniforms but with minor alterations to rank lace, buttons and cap ribbons which satisfied the Admiralty&rsquo;s requirement. These minor differences also served to distinguish one colonial naval force from another and before long a number of distinctive buttons, cap ribbons and a variety of rank lace featuring triangles, diamonds, crossed-anchors and stars began to appear throughout the colonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20002%20Colonial.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20002%20Colonial.jpg?itok=9vekpnFK\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: A Lieutenant of the colonial Victorian Navy.

Left: Captain JCP Walcot, Commandant of the South Australian Naval forces. Right: Commander CJ Clare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the early 1880s the uniform that stylised the &lsquo;sailor suit&rsquo; had evolved with seamen generally appearing in blue serge or white duck (heavy cotton) jumpers, frocks and bell-bottomed trousers. On frocks and jumpers a blue jean collar decorated with three rows of white tape was worn. Contrary to popular belief the white tape did not commemorate Vice Admiral Lord Nelson&rsquo;s victories at the Nile, Copenhagen and Trafalgar for even the United States and German navies made use of this distinction from a very early time. Both jumpers and frocks were worn over a white, square cut flannel shirt, the neck of which was also bound with blue cotton tape. A black silk scarf worn around the neck and secured to the front of the jumper with blue or white tape tied in a bow added a certain amount of panache to the appearance of the wearer. The addition of a white lanyard, also worn around the neck and tucked inside the jumper completed the ensemble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20004%20Colonial%20ratings.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20004%20Colonial%20ratings.jpg?itok=qKnRlKix\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: A colonial petty officer and rating of the the Victorian naval forces. The white stripe on the trouser leg of the junior rating was peculiar to the Victorian naval forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rig was designed to be practical. The voluminous cut of the bell-bottom trousers enabled them to be removed rapidly, irrespective of footwear, and discarded to improve the chance of survival should a sailor go overboard. The seven horizontal creases ironed in each trouser leg enabled the garment to be concertinaed and rolled, inside out, so that they remained clean, taking up little room in lockers or kit bags. This method also prevented them from further unwanted creasing. The number of horizontal creases in each trouser leg was incidental although a popular belief emerged that the number was chosen to represent the seven seas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origin of the blue jean collar stems from the days of sail when it was popular for sailors to plait and tar their hair in a ponytail, the intent of the collar being to prevent the tar from staining the uniform beneath it. The black headscarf, that was once used to absorb sweat in crowded gun decks, is today worn only as a decorative feature comprising a strip of black silk secured by tapes and a bow to the front of the jumper. Also now decorative in nature is the white lanyard to which a seaman&rsquo;s knife was once secured. In days gone by the knife would sit snugly in a pocket stitched to the front left breast of a seaman&rsquo;s jumper. The pocket was later moved inside the jacket and out of sight remaining there until well after World War II. If the knife was required for use, the lanyard was slipped from around the neck and looped around one&rsquo;s waist providing ready access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20005%20Jumper.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20005%20Jumper.jpg?itok=vlYhjSOa\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design of seamen&#39;s jumpers initially incorporated a pocket on the front left breast to accommodate a dirk that was secured to a white rope lanyard worn around the neck. The rating at the left wears the distinctive cap ribbon of the New South Wales Naval Artillery Volunteers and a black leather &#39;snake-belt&#39; around his waist. Below: A seaman&#39;s dirk of the type attached to the white rope lanyard. This useful tool included a blade, marlin spike and screw-driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Dirk.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Dirk.jpg?itok=dTDnHywH\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Headwear for Seamen consisted of either a peak-less round blue or white cloth cap, or a straw sennet hat for use in hot weather. From 1868, all caps and hats worn by Seamen had black hat ribbons with gilt wire lettering bearing the name of their ship tied around them. The position of the bow securing the ribbon, however, moved variously and during World War I and II could often be found positioned over the left eye. Eventually it was decreed that all cap ribbons would be tied with the bow sitting neatly above the left ear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief Petty Officers (CPO) were dressed in double-breasted long jackets fastened with gilt buttons, matching trousers and peaked caps of the same design as officers. The caps were embellished with a gilt wire badge depicting the sovereign&rsquo;s crown above a rope-fouled Admiralty pattern anchor on a black background. For CPOs of the Seaman Branch, the crown was of gold and the anchor was of silver. For all others, both were of gold. Engine room artificers had one further distinction; the background on which their anchor was affixed was purple instead of black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20006%20CPO%20cap%20badges_0.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20006%20CPO%20cap%20badges_0.jpg?itok=3_C3jf96\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples of early cap badges worn by Chief Petty Officers c.1901. Later, when a laurel wreath was added, this design was adopted by petty officers. The badge at the right is an an example of that worn by Chief Petty Officer engine room artificers of the Royal Naval Reserve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, in July 1920, a new cap badge for CPOs was introduced into the RAN. The new badge featured a silver anchor surrounded by a narrow wreath of laurel leaves in gold, surmounted by the Tudor crown. Thereafter, the cap badge previously worn by CPOs was adopted by petty officers that had attained four years seniority. These badges continue to be worn to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20007%20Evolution%20of%20CPO%20cap%20badge.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20007%20Evolution%20of%20CPO%20cap%20badge.jpg?itok=8c8Bg6Zj\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief Petty Officers spanning more than 100 years of naval service.Today &#39;Chiefs&#39; are easily recognisable by their distinctive cap badge and category badges worn on the lapels of their No1 jackets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1890 the variety of uniforms available to officers was extensive with a uniform available for every conceivable occasion, ranging from the impressive double-breasted full dress uniform, to the uninspiring yet practical sou&rsquo;wester foul weather hat. The late 19th century was also a time of great technological change. Sail was giving way to steam and wooden hulled ships were replaced by ironclads equipped with high calibre guns in lieu of cannons. With this new technology came the need for more specialised officers and ratings to man the ships and in a very short period of time a variety of new trades appeared throughout the navy. With these new trades came the introduction of non-substantive rate badges that were worn on the right arm to identify specific specialisations. Some of the earliest of these included gunners, stokers, artisans and signalmen. Substantive badges, denoting rank, were worn on the left arm along with good conduct chevrons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20008%20Rate%20badges.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20008%20Rate%20badges.jpg?itok=Uavd4XgP\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A selection of early, red embroidered, rate badges.

This gave them a colourful appearance, with Mechanical Engineers adopting purple cloth, Paymasters white, Surgeons red and Electrical Engineers green, to name just a few. It is from the green that the term &lsquo;greenie&rsquo; originates which remains in use to this day to describe any personnel of the Electrical Branch. Officers of the Medical and Dental Branches continue the tradition of wearing distinction cloth to this day primarily to identify them as non-combatants. Officers of the Executive Branch have traditionally worn none.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20009%20Distinction%20cloth.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20009%20Distinction%20cloth.jpg?itok=t0IJqHF8\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: A full dress uniform of a Surgeon Commander, circa 1918, with red distinction cloth clearly visible between the rank lace on the sleeve. Right: Swatches of distinction cloth used to distinguish officers of the Engineering (purple) and Ordnance Branches (blue).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Commonwealth Naval Forces</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On 1 March 1901, the Australian States transferred their naval forces and all persons &lsquo;employed in their connexion&rsquo; to the Federal Government, creating the Commonwealth Naval Forces (CNF). There were no immediate changes to uniforms and for a period the CNF was a consolidated navy in name only, with each state continuing to wear their former colonial uniforms. It was not until 1904 that new uniform regulations were promulgated. These instructions ordered officers of the CNF to wear the uniform prescribed in the King&rsquo;s Regulations for officers and men of the RN with only minor modifications to rank lace. This involved the substitution of a triangle in place of the executive curl for Seaman Officers and the substitution of a gold star for officers of non-executive branches such as paymasters and engineers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petty Officers, men and boys, adopted the same uniform as that worn in the RN with the exception that cap ribbons were lettered H.M.A.S [His Majesty&rsquo;s Australian Ship] followed by the name of their ship. This early reference to use of the letters &lsquo;H.M.A.S&rsquo; preceding ship&rsquo;s names is noteworthy, as it was not until 1911 that King George V officially approved the designation &lsquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s Australian Ship&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20010%20CNF.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20010%20CNF.jpg?itok=lJyDsQ3E\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: Captain WR Creswell was appointed the first Director of the Commonwealth Naval Forces in 1904. He can be seen here dressed in a frock coat laced with the design approved for the new naval forces featuring a triangle in lieu of the executive curl. Right: A junior rating dressed in blues wearing an early cap ribbon lettered HMAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Royal Australian Navy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The granting of the Royal title in 1911, coupled with the arrival of the Australian fleet unit in October 1913, removed any lingering concerns the Admiralty held concerning Australian naval men wearing RN uniform and in 1913 the RAN received approval to adopt the full range of uniforms, badges and insignia of the RN. The only differences that remained between the two were minor changes to buttons and cap ribbons referencing Australia. For many, this was viewed as the final affirmation that Australia&rsquo;s naval forces, as the embryonic RAN, had come of age. 1913 also saw the formation of the Naval Dockyard Police and the first permanent RAN band that paraded dressed in a version of the uniform worn by the Royal Marines Band Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Buttons.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Buttons.jpg?itok=kxcrKoSs\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The buttons introduced for use following the granting of the &#39;Royal&#39; title in 1911. L-R: Black horn button worn by ratings not dressed as Seamen, gilt button worn by Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officers, and the gilt button with rope circlet approved for officers. The tilted anchor is often referred to as a &#39;lazy&#39; anchor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1914, as war clouds gathered, the rank of Lieutenant Commander was introduced taking its place in the hierarchical structure above Lieutenants and below Commanders. This saw the familiar &lsquo;half&rsquo; stripe introduced between the existing rank-lace worn by Lieutenants. It did not take long for those serving in the lower deck to coin the term &lsquo;two-and-a half&rsquo; to describe officers of that rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following year saw Engineering Officers granted use of the executive curl on their upper rank stripe and by 1918 the remaining non-executive officers had received similar approval, although the practice of wearing coloured distinction cloth continued until April 1955.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all of the RAN&rsquo;s personnel went to war in navy blue. Members of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/history/feature-histories/1st-royal-australian-naval-bridging-train\">1st Royal Australian Naval Bridging Train</a>, an engineering unit, served at Gallipoli and throughout the Middle East dressed in the olive drab uniform of the 1st Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Their Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Commander LS Bracegirdle, RAN, saw a need to distinguish between the two forces and designed large, stockless anchor badges to identify them as sailors, these were worn in lieu of the army&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rising Sun&rsquo; badges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between World War I and the outbreak of World War II a variety of new categories made their appearance including divers and dental mechanics. CPOs uniforms were also altered slightly when approval was given in January 1926 for three large gilt buttons to be added to the cuffs of blue jackets and white tunics. The combination of buttons on the cuffs coupled with the wearing of non-substantive badges on the lapels of the blue jacket became synonymous with the CPO rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Divers.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Divers.jpg?itok=6SA5QaGA\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above: The Siebe Gorman standard diving dress and rate badge introduced for ratings qualified as &#39;hard&#39;hat&#39; divers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 1928 a new style of RAN button was introduced, comprising a vertical stockless anchor replacing the previously worn &lsquo;lazy&rsquo; anchor. This style has endured to this day, albeit since 1953 with the St Edward&rsquo;s crown in lieu of a Tudor crown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%202%20-%20LCDR%20epaulettes%20in%20case.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%202%20-%20LCDR%20epaulettes%20in%20case.jpg?itok=voSUUdwt\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: Officer&#39;s full dress epaulettes were often purchased privately and secured, along with cocked hats, in velvet-lined tin chests. In the RAN these were worn chiefly with frock coats. Above: Gilt buttons were struck from blanks using hob dies such as the one seen here to impress the design on the face of the button. These examples are of the buttons that replaced the &#39;lazy anchor&#39; device that were introduced on 13 March 1928.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The onset of war with Germany on 3 September 1939 triggered another technological revolution that saw the armed forces of the industrialised world rapidly advance in ways not previously considered possible. With new technologies and innovation came the requirement for a host of new categories in the RAN and a much more practical approach to dress. At the beginning of the war many battles were fought in what today would be considered to be ceremonial uniforms. By the war&rsquo;s end, thousands of sun-tanned Australian officers and sailors could be found throughout the Pacific, with bare chests or clad in khaki open necked shirts, shorts and sandals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%2015%20-%20AWM%20ART22171.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%2015%20-%20AWM%20ART22171.jpg?itok=nc1NJFxO\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: Leading Signalman JW Varcoe, DSM, (John Longstaff, oil on canvas, 1921, AWM ART 02996). During World War I and the early stages of World War II it was not uncommon for ratings serving in the Dominion navies to go into action wearing this uniform. Over time, a much more practical approach to apparell was adopted as can be seen in Henry Hanke&#39;s painting of Able Seaman J Walker who is dressed in a protective anti-flash hood and gloves and who wears an inflatable life-belt. (AWM ART 22171)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World War II also saw the institution of the Women&rsquo;s Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) and the Royal Australian Navy Nursing Service (RANNS). From 1941, Australia&rsquo;s first female sailors could be found performing a variety of critical jobs ashore dressed in navy blue jackets, skirts and felt fur hats. By the end of the war they too had added a more practical khaki coloured working rig to their kit that was better suited to the hot Australian climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Women.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Women.jpg?itok=jcPDZeab\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: Third Officer J Cowie and Telegraphist MJ Walton, both of the Women&#39;s Royal Australian Naval Service, captured on canvas by Henry Hawke (AWM ART23956).

By the war&#39;s end in 1945, members of the Women&#39;s Royal Australian Naval Service could also be found serving in northern climes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The women&rsquo;s services were briefly disbanded after the war but in 1951 the WRANS was resurrected. In the same year, post war kit was approved which saw the introduction of light blue embroidered badges for ratings and the distinctive tricorne hat for officers, CPOs and petty officers. Later the RANNS was also reinstituted and they too adopted their own distinctive uniforms and insignia, more befitting with their role as nurses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/WRANS%20hats.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/WRANS%20hats.jpg?itok=rrxntXqY\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: Post-war kit for members of the WRANS was approved in March 1951. At that time the tricorn hat in use by Britain&#39;s Women&#39;s Royal Naval Service was adopted for wear by officers and senior rates with winter uniform whereas as a white wide-brimmed hat was approved for use with summer rigs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Wran%20OCs.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Wran%20OCs.jpg?itok=MZKghRh_\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WRANS officer candidates embarked in a work-boat in Sydney, they wear white HMAS CERBERUS cap ribbons to denote their status as potential officers.

Generally they wore the same uniform as officers and ratings of the permanent forces although officers were easily distinguishable by their waved rank lace that appeared in two different styles. One for the Royal Australian Naval Reserve Seagoing (RANR(S)) and another for officer of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve (RANR) and Royal Australian Navy Volunteer Reserve (RANVR). All were coined to be officers of the &lsquo;wavy navy&rsquo; because of their distinctive rank lace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Rockies%20001.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Rockies%20001.jpg?itok=MhEgBL9D\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: Leading Signalman S Chant of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve dressed in &#39;blues&#39; and wearing a cap ribbon of H.M.A. NAVAL RESERVE.

Note the RANR (NS) cap ribbons and sleeve badges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chaplains too, have been a constant in the RAN since its inception, although it took many years for them to gain approval to wear naval uniform. It was not until 1940 that a peaked cap and distinctive cap badge was approved for them to wear with a basic form of naval uniform replacing traditional clerical attire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20001%20Chaplain%20compilation%20large.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20001%20Chaplain%20compilation%20large.jpg?itok=11uJEgh9\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: The device introduced for RAN chaplains to wear on shoulder boards to identify their status as non-combatants.

Soon pilots, observers, air crewmen, aircraft handlers, meteorologists, photographers, safety equipment personnel and myriad other air engineering trades swelled the ranks of the RAN. Flying clothing was introduced as were a host of new non-substantive rate badges and other items of uniform including the black wool beret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Birdies.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Birdies.jpg?itok=1shu_j_J\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captain VAT Smith, DSC, RAN, wearing his distinctive aircrew observers wings on his left breast. Note that he has retained the wings awarded to him under the reign of King George VI - distinguishable by the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s&rsquo; crown. This was common practice among many who had earned their &lsquo;wings&rsquo; during wartime. Top: An example of a black wool beret adopted not only by aircrew but also naval apprentices and junior recruits. The establishment of a Fleet Air Arm saw numerous new non-substantive rate badges introduced and a number of specialist flying badges such as the pilot qualification badge and aircrewman badge depicted here. In 1966 gilt metal brooches replaced gold embroidered flying badges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1948 the electrical branch was instituted and with it came the first appearance of the familiar crossed lightning bolts on badges of the electrical category. Previously electrical duties had been discharged by men of the torpedo category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Action working dress, comprising a light blue, long-sleeved shirt and dark blue cotton drill trousers, made its debut in March 1948. This practical hard-wearing working rig could be considered to be the forerunner of today&rsquo;s DPNUs as it was one of the first uniforms to place practicality over appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%2038%20-%20Action%20Working%20Dress.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%2038%20-%20Action%20Working%20Dress.jpg?itok=O-Wx5c_g\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: In use from 1948 through to the late 1990s action working dress was the forerunner of DPNU. Right: Junior recruits at HMAS Leeuwin, WA, report for duty dressed in action working dress and black wool berets. Those wearing class II caps are dutymen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another practical introduction followed in May 1950 when a new short-sleeved white bush jacket was introduced for officers of captain&rsquo;s rank and above for use in tropical climates. Bush jackets remained an optional item of kit until 30 July 2009, at which time they were removed from the approved RAN clothing list. Today it is an optional piece of kit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 the RAN again found itself on active service. For those who served throughout the conflict it is often remembered for its freezing winter temperatures which saw many personnel resort to wearing warm civilian apparel in conjunction with their uniforms in an effort to keep warm, a lament of sailors since they first put to sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%2076%20Korea%20signalman%20AWM%20305190.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%2076%20Korea%20signalman%20AWM%20305190.jpg?itok=Vin3K0O7\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above: At times service at sea can prove particularly unpleasant for personnel exposed on the upper deck necessitating a need for robust foul weather clothing as can be seen in these images taken during the Korean War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 6 February 1952 King George VI died and Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne. The change in monarch marked the end of over fifty years of rule by successive British kings, all of whom had adopted the Tudor crown as the symbol of their authority. After Queen Elizabeth II&rsquo;s coronation in June 1953, the St Edwards Crown was adopted, replacing the Tudor Crown on badges, insignia, buttons and accoutrements of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s armed forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%2095%20QC%20Officers%20Cap%20Badge.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%2095%20QC%20Officers%20Cap%20Badge.jpg?itok=xihB50tp\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After HM Queen Elizabeth&#39;s coronation in June 1953 a revised pattern naval officer&#39;s cap badge was introduced incorporating the St Edwards Crown. Know colloquially as the &#39;Queen&#39;s Crown&#39; it also replaced all existing Tudor Crowns on badges, buttons and accoutrements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 1952 saw the establishment of the Clearance Diving (CD) category and from September 1954, the letter &lsquo;C&rsquo; was added below the diver&rsquo;s non-substantive rate badge to indicate the CD qualification. The 1950s saw the demise of officer&rsquo;s distinction cloth (with the exception of the medical and dental branches) and the abandonment of waved lace for officers of the reserve forces. They instead adopted a small letter &lsquo;R&rsquo; which was centred in the loop of the executive curl. This too was done away with in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the 1960s came the missile age and the beginning of Australia&rsquo;s involvement in the Vietnam War. Between 1965 and 1972 elements of the RAN undertook continuous service in Vietnam as sea, ashore and in the air. Once again it was the environment in which RAN personnel were serving that influenced changes to uniforms, placing practicality ahead of appearance. Both clearance divers and aviators of the RAN could be found serving ashore in Vietnam dressed in army style &lsquo;jungle greens&rsquo;, while in ships on the gun line, officers serving in the RAN&rsquo;s destroyers adopted the khaki uniforms worn by their counterparts of the US Navy&rsquo;s Seventh Fleet. The 1960s also saw the RAN band shift out of their Royal Marine styled uniforms and into traditional naval rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Image%20043%20arming%20gunship%20small.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Image%20043%20arming%20gunship%20small.jpg?itok=vV2EE9-V\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the Royal Australian Navy Helicopter Flight Vietnam arming a gunship prior to a mission.

Prior to January 1960 RAN musicians were dressed in a derivative of Royal Marine Band uniforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 25 July 1966 the Naval Board approved the introduction of a distinctive badge for wear by qualified RAN submarine personnel. The badge was of gold-plated gilding metal in the form of a brooch depicting two dolphins, nose-to-nose, supporting a crown. Its design is attributed to Captain AH McIntosh, RAN, (Ret&#39;d). Since that time the badge has been proudly worn by thousands of RAN submariners who have earnt the right to wear it on their left breast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Submariners%20.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Submariners%20.jpg?itok=fsvLJ8iG\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: Nicknamed the &#39;kissing kippers&#39; the RAN submarine qualification badge has been worn with pride since 1966. Right: The white polar-necked submarine jumper has also become a symbol of serving in the &#39;Silent Service&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction of gilt metal qualification badges for submariners inspired a revision of the existing patterns for aircrew badges and in 1966 approval was given for gold plated, gilding metal badges to replace existing cloth flying badges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Aircrew%20wings.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Aircrew%20wings.jpg?itok=pzI25IH2\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top: The revised Aircrew qualification badges introduced in 1966.

Warrant Officers had originally worn a single thin stripe and executive curl on the sleeves of their jackets and on shoulder boards to signify their rank. The new insignia comprised the Australian coat-of-arms which was worn on the sleeves of blue jackets, and as a small gilt device on epaulettes. The cap badge introduced, seen above, was a deriviant of the existing Chief Petty Officer&#39;s badge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/WO-N.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/WO-N.jpg?itok=lZbVIcc2\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1993 the rank of Warrant Officer of the Navy was introduced in the RAN. This saw the introduction of a new rank badge of the type seen at left. Right: WO-N Gary Wight is congratulated by the outgoing WO-N Martin Holzberger following a brief handover ceremony. Coincidentally, both were submariners and can be seen wearing the submarine qualification badge on their left breast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1970s and 1980s saw the introduction of further new non-substantive badges, particularly for technical sailors whose badges were adorned with a variety of stars to denote technical expertise and skill. Specialist badges for principal warfare officers were also approved as were navy blue jumpers, known as &lsquo;woolly pullies&rsquo;, which made their debut in the mid-1980s. With them came the first of the RAN&rsquo;s soft rank insignia that was worn on the shoulders. The disbandment of the WRANS followed and for the first time, women adopted the traditional uniforms of the sailor, as the RAN became one service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Wide%20brimmed%20hat%20and%20Sun%20glasses%20June%201994.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Wide%20brimmed%20hat%20and%20Sun%20glasses%20June%201994.jpg?itok=ZDWTjqK6\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: A leading seaman on duty on the gangway of a guided missile destroyer dressed in a traditional seaman&#39;s flannel or &#39;white-front&#39; as they were sometimes known.

This saw the traditional bell-bottom trousers and white flannels give-way to straight leg trousers and collared shirts for both male and female sailors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next major uniform change came with the advent of the first Gulf War when a need for a more robust form of action working dress was identified. This saw the introduction of grey, fire retardant, combat coveralls that were soon adopted throughout the entire RAN fleet. Around the same time, approval was also given for personnel serving ashore in operational areas to wear army disruptive pattern camouflage uniforms (DPCU). This was to become standard kit for officers and men of the clearance diving branch due to the nature of their work. A second variant, known as disruptive pattern desert uniform (DPDU), featuring sandy coloured tones better suited for operations in the Middle East Region followed and many naval personnel found themselves wearing this pattern while deployed ashore overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/CAMS.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/CAMS.jpg?itok=2_vqgfBk\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Left: Members of HQ INTERFET&#39;s Naval Component Command, wearing the military pattern DPCU, East Timor, 1999.

Practical and hard-wearing it has proved popular throughout the Navy. In 2021 a second pattern DPNU was released, again subtly changing the appearance of naval personnel.

On discovering that the First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr Winston Churchill, had &ldquo;monopolised the red pencils and ink for his minutes, Fisher seized the green and used that colour exclusively&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/Jackie%20Fisher%20Rush...jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/Jackie%20Fisher%20Rush...jpg?itok=Xy-z31CR\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example of the rush label applied to naval signals, this practice was instituted by First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jackie Fisher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henceforth the use of green ink by successive First Sea Lords, Chiefs of Naval Staff and Chiefs of Navy both in the RN and RAN took hold becoming an enduring tradition.&nbsp;In today&#39;s digital age the use of green font routinely substitutes the more traditional green pen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/VADM%20Noonan.jpg\"><img alt=\"Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, AO, RAN, signs the Hydroscheme Industry Partnership Program Commemoration Certificate during a Ceremony held at Russell Offices, Canberra.\" src=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/VADM%20Noonan.jpg?itok=ZTcmE6ml\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, AO, RAN, signs the Hydroscheme Industry Partnership Program Commemoration Certificate during a Ceremony held at Russell Offices, Canberra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/CN%20signing.jpg\"><img alt=\"Vice Admiral Tim Barrett, AO, CSC, RAN, shakes hands with Vice Admiral Jesus Millan, AFP, Flag Officer in-Command Philippine Navy, after signing the official documentation for the Australian government to gift two decommissioned Landing Craft Heavy to the Government of the Philippines.\" src=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_full_width_no_sidebar/public/CN%20signing.jpg?itok=slLSwGGQ\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vice Admiral Tim Barrett, AO, CSC, RAN, shakes hands with Vice Admiral Jesus Millan, AFP, Flag Officer in-Command Philippine Navy, after signing the official documentation for the Australian government to gift two decommissioned Landing Craft Heavy to the Government of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Green Ink Banner...jpg', '2020-08-07 20:05:41', 1, 8),

This allowed the ship to be built at a number of different sites across the shipyard before being brought together for final joining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction of the hull to the level of the flight deck, including the majority of fitting out was undertaken at Navantia&#39;s Ferrol-Fene shipyard in north-west Spain. The hull was then shipped to BAES&#39; Williamstown shipyard in Victoria for the installation of the island structure. The island modules were constructed at a number of sites around Australian before they were moved to Williamstown for final installation on the flight deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ship&#39;s roles are to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>embark, transport and deploy an embarked force (Army in the case of the ADF but could equally be an allied Army or Marines), along with their equipment and aviation units, and</li>\r\n	<li>carry out/support humanitarian missions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The first LHD,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-canberra-iii\">HMAS Canberra</a>, commissioned on 28 November 2014 and the second ship,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-adelaide-iii\">HMAS Adelaide</a>, commissioned on 4 December 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ship is a conventional steel mono hull design with the superstructure located on the starboard side of the flight deck. There are four main decks: the Well Dock and Heavy Vehicle Deck for heavy vehicles and/or cargo; Main Accommodation Deck, including the Primary Casualty Reception Facility (PCRF); Hangar and Light Vehicle Deck for light weight vehicles and cargo; and the Flight Deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LHD has been designed with the shallowest possible draft to allow her to operate in secondary ports and harbours as well as manoeuvre tactically in the shallow waters common in the littoral regions. Maximum speed is in excess of 20kn with a range of 6,000nm, a sustained maximum speed of 19kn under full-load conditions and an economic cruising speed of 15kn with a range of 9,000nm. She can also reverse with full directional control at up to 8kn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LHD has a stern ramp/door that provides access to the well dock for landing craft and vehicles along with a fixed ramp (steel beach) between the well dock and the heavy vehicle/cargo deck (1,410m2). Additionally two lateral ramp doors are located on the starboard side and provide wharf access to the heavy vehicle/cargo deck for vehicles up to 65T. Vehicular access between the heavy and light vehicle decks is achieved via a fixed ramp located on the port side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The well dock is 69.3m long and 16.8m wide (1,165m2) and the LHD will normally carry four LCM 1E. An additional four RHIBs can be carried behind the LCM 1Es, however this will be mission dependant rather than a normal load out. The well dock has been designed to handle water craft of allied nations, including LCUs, amphibious vehicles and LCACs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main accommodation deck is located above the well dock and heavy vehicle/cargo deck and includes crew accommodation, mess decks, medical spaces, galley facilities, office spaces, and recreation rooms. Accommodation is provided for 1400 personnel; approximately 400 ship&rsquo;s company including the watercraft and flight deck crews and 1,000 embarked force personnel including the PCRF, embarked flight, HQ staff and landing force. The LHD will be jointly crewed with personnel from Navy, Army and the Air Force forming the ship&rsquo;s company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LHD&#39;s flight deck is 202.3m long and 32m wide (4750m2), allowing the ship to operate a range of ADF rotary wing aircraft including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>MRH-90 Taipan</li>\r\n	<li>CH-47 Chinook</li>\r\n	<li>Blackhawk</li>\r\n	<li>ARH Tiger</li>\r\n	<li>Romeo Seahawk</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The flight deck has been configured with six spots on the port side for medium sized aircraft such as the MRH-90 or Blackhawk, which allows for simultaneous take off and landing operations; alternatively it can support simultaneous take off and landing operations of four CH-47 Chinooks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two aircraft elevators - one aft of the flight deck and one fwd of the island on the stbd side - that can accommodate medium sized helicopters, with the after one able to accommodate larger helicopters such as CH 47. Both aircraft elevators service the hangar and light vehicle/cargo deck and the fwd elevator is dual roled for stores and personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between the flight deck and the accommodation deck is a contiguous hangar and light vehicle deck; the hanger (990m2) occupying the after section of the deck while the light vehicle deck (1880m2) is located on the forward section of the deck. The hanger can accommodate up to 8 medium sized helicopters with 18 medium sized helicopters able to be accommodated if the light vehicle deck is also used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a cargo lift that can be used to transfer 20-foot ISO containers and vehicles up to a weight of 16 tonnes between the heavy and light vehicle decks. There are also lifts for ammunition, provisions and casualties. Up to 110 vehicles, depending on the size and configuration, can be loaded across the two vehicles decks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Command and Control (C2) and Combat Systems will consist of:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Combat Management System</li>\r\n	<li>Extensive ICT infrastructure to support the ADF&rsquo;s Command Support Systems and provide C2 capability for the embarked force</li>\r\n	<li>3D Air Search Radar</li>\r\n	<li>Helicopter Control and Surface Radar</li>\r\n	<li>Navigation Radar</li>\r\n	<li>IFF capability, including Mode S</li>\r\n	<li>ESM/ECM Suite</li>\r\n	<li>Integrated communications system (internal and external), including a Message Handling System, Link 11 and 16, civil and military Satellite Communications</li>\r\n	<li>Electro Optical and IR surveillance systems</li>\r\n	<li>Integrated Navigation System, including an integrated bridge, navigation sensors, AIS and WECDIS.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The LHD will be fitted with a number of defensive systems including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anti-Torpedo Towed Defense System (Nixie)</li>\r\n	<li>Four 20 mm automated guns</li>\r\n	<li>6 x 12.7 mm machine guns</li>\r\n	<li>Active missile decoy system - Nulka (weight and space reserve)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Major Statistics</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Length Overall 230.82m</li>\r\n	<li>Moulded Beam 32.00m</li>\r\n	<li>Beam Waterline 29.50m</li>\r\n	<li>Flight Deck height 27.50m</li>\r\n	<li>Draft at Full Load Displacement 7.08m</li>\r\n	<li>Full Load Displacement 27,500 tonnes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The LHD utilises an electric drive system similar to that used by major cruise companies such as Cunard.
